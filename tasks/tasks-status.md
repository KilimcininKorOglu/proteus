## Changes Since Last Update
- Added: Implemented the v0.2 text batch applets `sed`, `sort`, `cut`, `tr`, and `uniq` with dispatch, feature wiring, metadata entries, and sandbox policy coverage.
- Modified: Completed T007 and validated the new applets with release-build smoke tests against real sample files.
- Warnings: PRD still states `MIT OR Apache-2.0`, but `Cargo.toml` is currently MIT-only. `cargo fmt --all --check` still reports pre-existing repository-wide formatting drift unrelated to this task.

## Milestone Timeline
| Milestone | Scope Focus                                  | Related Features |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------|
| v0.2      | Foundation closure + text processing batch    | F001, F002       |
| v0.3      | File utilities + awk                          | F002             |
| v0.4      | Network + process applets + sandbox runtime   | F001, F002, F004 |
| v0.5      | System utilities + init path                  | F002, F004       |
| v0.6      | POSIX shell expansion + interactive mode      | F003             |
| v0.7      | Editors, diff tools, remaining applet gaps    | F002, F003       |
| v0.8-v1.0 | Compliance, CI, release, cross-platform       | F004             |

## Current Sprint Focus
- T016: Expand POSIX grammar and execution coverage
- T008: Implement the v0.3 file utility batch
- T012: Fill remaining coreutils and misc gaps
- T013: Define applet compliance and help coverage

## Blocked Tasks
- None currently blocked at the planning level.

## Risk Items
- Feature declarations significantly outnumber implemented applets, which can create false completion signals.
- Shell scope is large enough to interfere with applet delivery if not milestone-bound.
- Security and release goals depend on integration work that is not yet connected to runtime behavior.
